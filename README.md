# Social Media as a File System (SMaaFS) - Proof of Concept
🚀 A research project exploring encrypted data storage and retrieval over social media.

## 🔍 What Is This?
SMaaFS is an experimental proof of concept that demonstrates how social media posts can be used as a distributed, encrypted data storage system. Instead of relying on centralized databases, this approach explores posting and retrieving encrypted data using standard social media platforms.

## 🛠 How It Works (Broad Overview)

🔒 Encrypts content before posting to social media.

📡 Retrieves encrypted posts and decrypts them locally.

🖥️ Runs as a browser extension for seamless integration.

🛑 Leaves no central metadata, keeping storage decentralized.

🔑 Features

✔ End-to-End Encryption – Strong cryptography ensures privacy.

✔ Decentralized Storage – No reliance on external databases.

✔ Stateless Design – No tracking, no central server.

✔ Browser-Based – Works as an easy-to-use extension.
